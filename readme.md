This is a weather app I created based on a youtube video done by [Great Stack](https://youtu.be/MIYQR-Ybrn4?si=6XPuY90kgZgcvm8O).

I followed the video to create the app the way he specified then I adjusted it to be custom based on some additions I wanted to add or elements I wanted to improve. The things I changed are below:

1. Made it response for mobile
2. made it so the colour of the background of the card changes with different weather
3. Made it so you can hit enter to search, so you aren't restricted to using a mouse to select the search button, instead you can enter something into search then just hit the enter/return key to do a search
4. Made the weather icons animate (still working on)
